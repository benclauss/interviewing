# Finding a Good Company

## Principles

- Find good foundation.
  - Are these good people?
  - Do they have interesting problems?
  - Do they have runway?
- Find the right deal.

> The startup you do/join needs to be super obvious why it exists and adds new value, but entirely non-obvious and hard to discover in the idea space.
> Just follow the smartest people you know.
> It's really important to be financially literate on startups specifically. If you don't know what a SAFE note, liquidation preference, common startup valuations at different rounds, and revenue plus growth vs valuation, you're mostly gambling.

## People

Work with ethical and generous people.

### Questions

- Why did you pick "Company"?
	- "My buddy was there." is not a good answer.
	- Look for **deliberateness**.
	- Who did *they* learn from? Was that successful?

## Executives

- How do they execute?
- How do they organize?
- What does an A player look like?

**Ask questions!**

**greatness = intellect + curiosity**
