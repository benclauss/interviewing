# LinkedIn

The following is material provided by an experienced recruiter I have worked with before.

### Networking
When a recruiter runs a search on LinkedIn, their results are listed and limited to their 1st, 2nd and 3rd level connections. If you are not connected on one of those levels, you will not show up in their search.
- Increase your network size! 
- Connect with past coworkers:
	- Mentors 
	- Past/Current Classmates  
	- Members of extracurriculars or groups
	- College alumni

**Note**: Some recruiters are subscribed with specific recruiter accounts which means they can view outside connections, but it is good to enhance your network in case a recruiter does not have said account.
### Groups
- Find groups on LinkedIn that are full of people who share similar interests both professionally and personally
- This will help keep you up to date and connect you with tons of people who share similar interests and passions.

## Profile Settings
- Set your profile to “open to new opportunities”.
	- LinkedIn has a built-in privacy settings that alert recruiters that you are open to new opportunities.
	- To do this, go to your profile and click privacy settings, scroll until you see “Let recruiters know you’re open to opportunities”
- Use keywords.
- Make yourself searchable!  
- Your education, graduation year and current title should all be listed on your profile.
	- Current Title: should be most common title for the thing that you do
	- Example: Technology Associate vs. Software Engineer  
- Edit your professional headline to include certain keywords that pertain to your interests and experience to your interests and experience.
- If you are stuck on choosing keywords, try revisiting the job descriptions for some of your top career choices and sift through to find any reoccurring titles, words, skills, etc.
- Use your keywords throughout the description of your experience section as well.  
- Fill out skills portion with specific languages, frameworks and software.
- Choose appropriate photos.
	- Your profile photo should not include any other people.
	- This means no mysterious arms around your shoulders or cut off cheeks!
- Your header photo should be a snapshot of who you are.
	- Travel photos of scenery or architecture are always good choices, especially if you took them yourself, this could spark a topic of discussion during an interview.
	- If you do not have any personal photos to use, search sites like https://www.pexels.com/ for some high-quality photos.
- Set a specific location.
	- This will help your recruiter decide whether you’d be willing to travel for the job.
	- If you want to work in Midtown Manhattan, do **not** say Greater NYC Area.
		- This will open you up to careers in the entire tri-state area rather than your preferred location.

## LinkedIn Jobs  
- Set up job alerts for careers listed on LinkedIn.
- This will keep you updated on any movement that is happening for your job of choice
- In Privacy Settings, you can opt in for sending recruiters your profile when a certain job opens.

## Follow Companies
- Follow companies that you are interested in.
- This will help you stay up to date with their internal happenings

## Quick Tips
- Customize your URL and put in on your resume.
- Ask previous coworkers to add a reference about you.
- Respond to every LinkedIn message you receive, even if you are not interested.
- Just tell them “Thanks for reaching out, but I’m not interested at this time.”
	- Recruiters can sort profiles by most and least likely to respond.
